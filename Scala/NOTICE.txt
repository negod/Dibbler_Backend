MongoDB with ReactiveMongo: a sample webapp

  This application manages articles. An article has a title, a text content and a publisher. The articles can be updated and sorted by title, publisher, creation/update date, etc. One or more attachments can be uploaded and bound to an article (like an image, a pdf, an archive...). All the classic CRUD operations are implemented.
  
  Enjoy!
